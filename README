This repository contains some small, useful programs and scripts (typically one
file) which scratch an itch for me; they're here in the hopes that they'll
scratch an itch for you too. Currently you will find:

spewcmd: Launch a command in the background with all output redirected to a file
         in /tmp, intended for launching GUI programs that like to spam your
         terminal; written in POSIX sh

dr:      Roll an arbitrary number of dice of an arbitrary size, using xdy
         notation (2d6, for instance). Written in C89 with two OpenBSD functions
         (strtonum(3) and, more importantly, arc4random_buf(3), both of which
         are in libbsd as of version 0.2.0).
